# EBuyOld

EBuyOld is a task that I've done for one of my job recruitment processes. I'm currently making another project with the same name (EBuy) because I love the name and I want to create a better project than this one with that name.

This project was done in September 2022, where I had only had 5 months of work experience in my first job in which I was using ASP.Net Core API to create and develop APIs for Philip Morris and Umbraco CMS to create and develop websites for TÃ¼rk Telekom. I believe I've done a decent job with this project considering my experience.

Nevertheless, considering my 1.5 years of current experience as a Software Engineer, this project is not fit to represent my expertise and I'm working on EBuy repository for a different and better e-commerce project.

I'll (hopefully) soon write and explanation on what this project does, how it works and how you can install it.
